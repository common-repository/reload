Automatically refresh your site if you update a post

== Description ==

This plugin will automatically refresh your visitors browsers, if you save a post (or page) in your wp-admin.
It works by checking for new posts regularly, and then reloading the browser to show the changes.

There is a chance however that this unexpected refresh could be annoying for some visitors, so use this plugin with caution!

There are no settings for this plugin at the moment, so if you activate it, it will just do it's magic. :)
You can disable it by deactivating the plugin.

Since v1.0.1 Formidable Forms are supported as well. A form submit will trigger a reload. In a next version I'll make this optional.

== Installation ==
